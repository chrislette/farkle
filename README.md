# farkle

I intend to create a way to play farkle in a website form

## Official Farkle Rules
![Farkle-Rules](Farkle-Rules.jpg)

The plan is to make it so I can adjust the rules a bit, to try out variations as well. A common "house-rule" I have is that Three 1s is 1000, and Four 1s is 1100, which we feel is more fair based on the standard amount for a single 1.
